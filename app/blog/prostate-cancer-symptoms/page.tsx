      <p className="text-lg mb-6 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting men, particularly as they age. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the symptoms of prostate cancer, risk factors, and when to seek medical attention.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Common Symptoms of Prostate Cancer</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">It's important to note that early-stage prostate cancer often has no symptoms. However, as the cancer progresses, you may experience:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700">
        <li>Frequent urination, especially at night</li>
        <li>Difficulty starting or stopping urination</li>
        <li>Weak or interrupted urine flow</li>
        <li>Painful or burning sensation during urination</li>
        <li>Difficulty having an erection</li>
        <li>Painful ejaculation</li>
        <li>Blood in urine or semen</li>
        <li>Deep pain in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs</li>
      </ul>

      <div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-100 rounded-xl p-6 mb-8">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">When to Seek Medical Attention</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          If you experience any of the symptoms listed above, especially if they persist for several weeks, it's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider. Remember, these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is not cancerous but may require treatment.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Risk Factors for Prostate Cancer</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">While the exact cause of prostate cancer is unknown, certain factors may increase your risk:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700">
        <li>Age: Risk increases significantly after age 50</li>
        <li>Race: African American men have a higher risk</li>
        <li>Family history: Having a close relative with prostate cancer increases risk</li>
        <li>Obesity: May be linked to more aggressive forms of prostate cancer</li>
        <li>Diet: High consumption of red meat and high-fat dairy products may increase risk</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Prostate Cancer Screening</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Regular screening is essential for early detection. The two main screening methods are:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Test:</strong> A blood test measuring PSA levels</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Rectal Exam (DRE):</strong> A physical examination to check for prostate abnormalities</li>
      </ol>
      <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
        Discuss with your doctor when you should start regular screenings based on your individual risk factors.
      </p>
